## Abstract
The C Language Integrated Production System, also known as CLIPS, is a public domain software tool mostly applied in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Systems. The concept of this project is to solve family tree-based problems with an acyclic structure of nodes. Given a set of rules and facts, the objective is to create a knowledge base for the following queries:

1. Enter the information from this family tree as a set of Prolog facts. Note that the females are Mum, Kydd, Elizabeth, Margaret, Diana, Anne, Sarah, Zara, Beatrice, and Eugenie.

2.	Add CLIPS rules that will allow you to infer information for the predicate grandChild, great Grandparent, brother, sister, daughter, son, aunt, uncle, brotherInLaw, sisterInLaw, and firstCousin. The creation of rules for additional predicates is encouraged.

3.	Test the CLIPS program by asking it who are Elizabeth’s grandchildren, Diana’s brothers-in-law, and Zara’s great-grandparents. Note, in some cases, it may be impossible to avoid getting the same answer more than once for a query.

## Origin
The first versions of CLIPS were developed starting in 1985 at NASA-Johnson Space Center (as an alternative to the existing system ART*Inference) until the mid-1990s when the development group's responsibilities ceased to focus on expert system technology. The original name of the project was "NASA's AI Language" (NAIL). CLIPS was probably the most widely used expert system tool as of 2005. CLIPS itself is written in C, extensions can be written in C, and CLIPS can be called from C. Its syntax resembles that of the programming language Lisp.
